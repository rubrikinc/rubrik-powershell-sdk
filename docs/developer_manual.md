# RSC PowerShell SDK Developer Manual

## Getting Started

See : [Getting Started](../README.md)

## How is the SDK useful

The SDK is useful for two main reasons:

- It provides a set of cmdlets that wrap
  the RSC GraphQL API, and make it easier
  to work with.
- It automatically converts the JSON
  responses from the RSC GraphQL API
  into PowerShell objects, which are
  easier to work with than JSON.

In the following, we will take a simple example, retrieving the list of
cluster IDs, and see how it can be done with the SDK.

First off, without the SDK, you would do a direct call to the RSC GraphQL API.

The query to run is:

```graphql
query {
  clusterConnection(sortBy:RegisteredAt) {
    nodes {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Assuming you have a valid API token stored in the `RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variable, you can run the query with `curl`:

```bash
curl --no-progress-meter --request POST --header "Content-Type: applic
ation/json" --header "Authorization: $RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://your-account.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql -d '{"query": "{clusterConnection(sortBy:RegisteredAt){nodes{id}}}"}'
```

The output will be a JSON object:
  
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "clusterConnection": {
        "nodes": [
          {
            "id": "9b429c53-2afe-44b5-b4e4-e3a4308a69fb"
          },
          {
            "id": "fd326eaa-534d-4f2a-861e-250d192fbaae"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

You would then need to parse the JSON, extract the cluster IDs, and store
them in a PowerShell array.

With the SDK, you can do the same thing with a single cmdlet:

```powershell
PS> (Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List ).Nodes.Id
9b429c53-2afe-44b5-b4e4-e3a4308a69fb
fd326eaa-534d-4f2a-861e-250d192fbaae
```

That's it! you don't need to write the GraphQL query, and you don't need
to parse the JSON response. That list of cluster IDs is already in a
PowerShell array, and you can use it directly.

Let's break down what that one-liner does.

First off, if you look at how many cmdlets are in the SDK, you could
be intrigued by its pretty small size:

```powershell
PS> (Get-Module RubrikSecurityCloud).ExportedCommands.Keys | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count
53
```

At the same time, the SDK covers all 650 queries
in the RSC GraphQL schema. How can that be?

The answer is that the SDK is built with a 2-layer command/subcommand
structure: Each cmdlet regroups a set of related queries, and each
subcommand corresponds to a specific query.

For example here, `Invoke-RscQueryCluster` is the cmdlet that regroups
all the queries related to clusters, and `-List` is the subcommand that
corresponds to the query we want to run.

You can see the list of all the cmdlets and their subcommands in
[this sample script](../Samples/AllCmdlets.sample.ps1)

Now, about the `().Nodes.Id`:

`Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List` returns a
[ClusterConnection object](https://rubrikinc.github.io/rubrik-api-documentation/schema/reference/clusterconnection.doc.html)
which contains a `Nodes` property, which is an array of `Cluster` objects,
which in turn have an `Id` property.

## Working directly with GraphQL queries

There are cases where you may want to work directly with GraphQL queries,
for example if you want to run a query that is not covered by the SDK,
or if you already have a GraphQL query that you want to run.

`Invoke-Rsc` is the cmdlet that allows you to do that.

Try: `Get-Help Invoke-Rsc -Full` for docs and examples.

To continue with our cluster id list example, you could do:

```powershell
PS> $query = "query Clusters{clusterConnection(sortBy:RegisteredAt){nodes{id}}}"
PS> (Invoke-Rsc  $query).Nodes.Id
9b429c53-2afe-44b5-b4e4-e3a4308a69fb
fd326eaa-534d-4f2a-861e-250d192fbaae
```

Note that `Invoke-Rsc` is still superior to just using `curl`:
the response is not JSON but native PowerShell objects.

Instead of specifying the query as a string, you can
also store your GraphQL queries in files
and then use the `-OperationFile` parameter
to run them. For example:

```powershell
$query = Get-Content -Path Samples/GetVsphereVmList.query.json -Raw
Invoke-Rsc -OperationText $query
```

You can also pass arguments to your query. For example if you wanted to
retrieve only the first cluster:

```powershell
PS> $query = "query Clusters(`$first: Int){clusterConnection(first: `$first, sortBy:RegisteredAt){nodes{id}}}"
PS> (Invoke-Rsc $query -Variables @{first=1}).Nodes.Id
9b429c53-2afe-44b5-b4e4-e3a4308a69fb
```

## Cmdlets

The SDK cmdlets can be divided into 3 categories:

- The core cmdlets: `Connect-Rsc`, `Disconnect-Rsc`, `Invoke-Rsc`,
  `Get-RscType`, `Get-RscCmdlet` and `Set-RscServiceAccountFile`.
- The operation cmdlets: `Invoke-RscQuery*` and `Invoke-RscMutate*` .
  These cmdlets are generated from the RSC GraphQL schema, and
  allow you to run any query or mutation.
- The wrapper cmdlets: all the rest that isn't a core cmdlet, and
  that doesn't start with `Invoke-Rsc` :

  These cmdlets are manually written, built on top of the operation cmdlets,
  and capture very common use cases:

  `Get-Rsc*`, `Set-Rsc*`, `Read-Rsc*`, `Write-Rsc*`,
  `Export-Rsc*` and `Import-Rsc*`.

To continue with our cluster id list example, with the `Invoke-Rsc`
core cmdlet, as we saw before, you would do:

```powershell
(Invoke-Rsc  "query {clusterConnection(sortBy:RegisteredAt){nodes{id}}}").Nodes.Id
```

We also saw that with the `Invoke-RscQueryCluster` operation cmdlet,
you would do:

```powershell
(Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List ).Nodes.Id
```

And finally, there is also a `Get-RscCluster` wrapper cmdlet:

```powershell
(Get-RscCluster).Id
```

The SDK is mostly automatically generated from the RSC GraphQL
schema, but we also curate a few wrapper scripts to cover very
common cases. For example, when running the `clusterConnection()`
GraphQL query, typically when looking at the response, you are
only interested in its `Nodes` field. So
[Get-RscCluster](../RubrikSecurityCloud/RubrikSecurityCloud.PowerShell/Public/Get-RscCluster.psm1)
is a wrapper cmdlet that runs the `clusterConnection()` query,
and returns the `Nodes` field (among other things).

## Finding your way around the SDK

The RSC schema is massive. The SDK introduces the concept of
cmdlets with _commands_ and _subcommands_ to help work with the schema:
instead of a giant flat list of cmdlets, you have a 2-level hierearchy
of cmdlets, with the first level being the _command_ - a general _area_
like MsSQL or AWS, and the second level being the _subcommand_ -
actionable operations like listing, creating, deleting etc. But even with
that, it can be hard to find the cmdlet you need. So let's look at 2
scenarios:

- I know what GraphQL operation I need to run, but I don't know what
  cmdlet to use :point_right: Finding a cmdlet by GraphQL operation
- I know the general area I need to work in, but I don't know what
  cmdlet to use :point_right: Finding a cmdlet by command and subcommand

### Finding a cmdlet by GraphQL operation

Say you know you need to run the `clusterConnection()` query, as we
saw before, you can always call `Invoke-Rsc` but there's a cmdlet
that's a better fit: `Invoke-RscQueryCluster`. How do you find it?

The SDK has a special cmdlet that helps you find cmdlets by GraphQL
operation name: `Get-RscCmdlet`. You can use it like this:

```powershell
PS> Get-RscCmdlet clusterConnection

GqlOperation      InvokeCommand
------------      -------------
clusterConnection Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List
```

Note that the output says `Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List` and not
just `Invoke-RscQueryCluster`.

### Finding a cmdlet by command and subcommand

Now say you know you want to send a query within the _cluster_ area, PowerShell
auto-completion is your friend, start by typing `Invoke-RscQuery` and then
pressing `Tab` twice:

```powershell
PS /Users/guirava/sdk> Invoke-RscQuery
Invoke-RscQueryAccount         Invoke-RscQueryMongo
Invoke-RscQueryActivitySeries  Invoke-RscQueryMssql
Invoke-RscQueryAws             Invoke-RscQueryNutanix
Invoke-RscQueryAzure           Invoke-RscQueryO365
Invoke-RscQueryAzureO365       Invoke-RscQueryOracle
Invoke-RscQueryCassandra       Invoke-RscQuerySla
Invoke-RscQueryCluster         Invoke-RscQueryVcenter
Invoke-RscQueryHyperv          Invoke-RscQueryVsphere
Invoke-RscQueryLdap            Invoke-RscQueryVsphereVm
```

Now you can see `Invoke-RscQueryCluster` is one of the options.

Let's see what subcommands are available for `Invoke-RscQueryCluster`:

```powershell
PS> Get-RscHelp Invoke-RscQueryCluster

Name             Description
----             -----------

```

Perousing the list, you can see that `List` is the subcommand you want.

### Determining a cmdlet's inputs

Now that you've found the cmdlet you want, how do you know what
parameters it takes?

In GraphQL, a given operation needs to be given a set of _arguments_, and
a _field specification_ that determines what fields are returned. In the
context of the SDK, we call the arguments `Var` and the field specification
`Field` (because PowerShell has the convention to use singular nouns).

You can see the arguments and fields for a given cmdlet by using the
`-GetInput` parameter to `Invoke-RscQueryCluster`:

```powershell
PS> Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List -GetInput

Op   Var                                             Field
--   ---                                             -----
List {[before, ], [filter, ], [after, ], [first, ]…} ClusterConnection
```

Note that when passing `-GetInput` to a cmdlet, it does not actually
reach out to the RSC API server, but only return info about its inputs.

Also note that you are only required to pass arguments that are
required by the GraphQL operation. For example, the `List` operation
does not require any arguments, so you can call it like this:

```powershell
PS> Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List
```

and the SDK automatically fills in the field specification.

Now let's say you only want to retrieve the first 3 clusters, you can
pass the `first` argument like this:

```powershell
$inputs=(Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List -GetInput)
$inputs.Var["first"]=3
Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List -Var $inputs.Var
```

If the field specification is not given, the SDK fills it in automatically
with sensible defaults, but you can also specify it yourself:

Let's look at what the default field spec looks like for the `Nodes` field:

```powershell
PS> (Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List -Var $inputs.Var).Nodes[0]

PauseStatus                     : NOT_PAUSED
Status                          : DISCONNECTED
SubStatus                       : DEFAULT
SystemStatus                    : FATAL
Type                            : ROBO
DefaultAddress                  :
EncryptionEnabled               :
EstimatedRunway                 :
Id                              : 9b429c53-2afa-44b1-b4e4-e3a4308a69fb
IsHealthy                       : False
LastConnectionTime              :
Name                            : WestWales
NoSqlWorkloadCount              :
PassesConnectivityCheck         :
RegistrationTime                :
SnapshotCount                   :
SystemStatusMessage             : 1 Node Down.
Timezone                        :
Version                         :
```

Note how the `Version` field is not automatically retrieved by the SDK:

```powershell
PS> $inputs.Field.Nodes[0].Version -eq $null
True
```

Any field in the field spec that is set to null is not retrieved by the SDK.
To retrieve it, you just have to set it to something else than null;
it doesn't matter what, as long as it's not null.
Let's add it to the field spec:

```powershell
$inputs.Field.Nodes[0].Version="fetch"
```

Here we set it to `"fetch"` but anything would work.

Now let's run the command again, with the new field spec:

```powershell
PS> (Invoke-RscQueryCluster -List -Var $inputs.Var -Field $inputs.Field).Nodes[0]

PauseStatus                     : NOT_PAUSED
Status                          : DISCONNECTED
SubStatus                       : DEFAULT
SystemStatus                    : FATAL
Type                            : ROBO
DefaultAddress                  :
