### MalwareScanStats
Supported in v6.0+

- numFiles: System.Int64
  - Required. Supported in v6.0+
The number of files encountered during the scan.  This may be less than the total number of files in the snapshot if the scan terminates early.

  - Required. Supported in v6.0+
The number of files scanned.
- totalFilesScannedSizeBytes: System.Int64
