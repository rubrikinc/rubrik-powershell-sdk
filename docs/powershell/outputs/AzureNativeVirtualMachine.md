### AzureNativeVirtualMachine
An Azure Native Virtual Machine that refers to the Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) used to deploy persistent VMs. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/.

- region: AzureNativeRegion
  - Azure region where the virtual machine (VM) is located.
- vmName: System.String
  - Name of the Virtual Machine (VM).
- sizeType: System.String
  - Size type of the virtual machine (VM). For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-general.
- vnetName: System.String
  - Name of the Virtual Network (VNet) associated with the virtual machine (VM).
- subnetName: System.String
  - Name of the subnet associated with the virtual machine (VM).
- isRelic: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether the virtual machine is a relic or not. A virtual machine is a relic when it is unprotected or deleted, but the previously taken snapshots of the virtual machine continue to exist within the Rubrik ecosystem.
- tags: list of AzureTags
  - List of tags associated with the virtual machine (VM).
- attachmentSpecs: list of AttachmentSpecsForVirtualMachines
  - Sequence of attachment specs for the virtual machine (VM).
- isAdeEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) exists on the virtual machine (VM) or not.
- osType: AzureNativeVmOsType
  - Type of the Operating System (OS) installed on the virtual machine (VM).
- availabilityZone: System.String
  - Availability Zone associated with the virtual machine (VM).
- virtuaMachineNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the the virtual machine (VM).
- isPreOrPostScriptEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether pre-script or post-script framework is enabled on the the virtual machine (VM) or not. When true, it facilitates application-consistent backups.
- vmAppConsistentSpecs: VmAppConsistentSpecsInternal
  - Application Consistent Specifications of the virtual machine (VM).
- isAppConsistencyEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether application consistent snapshots are enabled for this virtual machine (VM) or not. When enabled, Rubrik informs the Azure applications before taking snapshots, so apps can prepare. During the preparation phrase, Rubrik waits for the IO to be frozen and then the snapshot is taken. Once snapshot is taken, IO is unfreezed and the apps resume normal operation.
- availabilitySetNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the availability set associated with the virtual machine (VM).
- isAcceleratedNetworkingEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether accelerated networking is enabled on the virtual machine (VM) or not. Accelerated Networking improves the network performance on the VM. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking.
- isExocomputeConfigured: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether exocompute is configured for the region in which the virtual machine (VM) exists, or not. When the value is true, exocompute can be used to perform tasks like file indexing.
- isFileIndexingEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether file indexing is enabled for this virtual machine or not. When enabled, Rubrik scans the file structure within the virtual machine in a protected environment, where only the metadata such as folder structure, file names, and file sizes is accessible to Rubrik.
- isProtectable: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether the virtual machine is protectable. When the value is true, the virtual machine can be protected by assigning sla.
- privateIp: System.String
  - Private IP address of the virtual machine.
- cloudNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the the virtual machine (VM).
- nativeName: System.String
  - Azure Native name of the object.
- azureNativeResourceGroupAndSubscriptionDetails: AzureNativeResourceGroupAndSubscriptionDetails
  - Azure native resource group and subscription details.
- azureResourceGroupDetails: AzureResourceGroupDetails
  - Azure native resource group and subscription details.
- fileIndexingStatus: FileIndexingStatus
  - Specifies the file indexing status for this virtual machine. When enabled, Rubrik scans the file structure within the virtual machine in a protected environment, where only the metadata such as folder structure, file names, and file sizes is accessible to Rubrik. If the status is not specified by the user, file indexing is automatically enabled when archival is configured.
- authorizedOperations: list of PolarisSnappableAuthorizedOperationsEnums
  - The authorized operations on the object.
- resourceGroup: AzureNativeResourceGroup
  - Resource Group of the Azure Virtual Machine (VM).
- azureResourceGroup: AzureNativeResourceGroup
  - Resource Group of the Azure Virtual Machine (VM).
- attachedManagedDisks: list of AzureNativeManagedDisks
  - List of Managed Disks attached to the Azure Virtual Machine (VM).
- hostInfo: PhysicalHost
  - Rubrik CDM host information for the Azure Virtual Machine added as a host to the cluster. The value is Null when the virtual machine is not added as a host on any Rubrik cluster.
- recoveryPlansInfo: list of RecoveryPlansInfos
  - List of Recovery Plans associated with the virtual machine.
