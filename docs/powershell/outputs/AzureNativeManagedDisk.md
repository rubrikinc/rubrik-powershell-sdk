### AzureNativeManagedDisk
An Azure Native Managed Disk that refers to the block storage designed to be used with Azure Virtual Machines. Some examples are: ultra disks, premium solid-state drives (SSD), standard SSDs, and standard hard disk drives (HDD). For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.

- region: AzureNativeRegion
  - Azure region where the Managed Disk is located.
- tags: list of AzureTags
  - List of tags associated with the Managed Disk.
- isRelic: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether the Managed Disk is a relic. When the value is true, the Managed Disk is a relic. A Managed Disk is a relic when it is unprotected or deleted, but the previously taken snapshots of the Managed Disk continue to exist within the Rubrik ecosystem.
- osType: AzureNativeVmOsType
  - Type of the Operating System (OS) installed on the Managed Disk.
- isAdeEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is enabled on the Managed Disk or not. When the value is true, ADE is enabled.
- diskSizeGib: System.Int32
  - Size of the Managed Disk in gigabytes (GiB).
- diskStorageTier: AzureNativeManagedDiskType
  - Storage tier of the Managed Disk.
- diskIopsReadWrite: System.Int64
  - Number of Input/Output operations Per Second (IOPS) allowed for the Managed Disk.
- diskMbpsReadWrite: System.Int64
  - Bandwidth allowed for the Managed Disk, in millions of bytes per second (MBps).
- availabilityZone: System.String
  - Availability Zone associated with the Managed Disk.
- attachmentSpecs: list of AttachmentSpecsForManagedDisks
  - Attachment Specifications are properties of the Managed Disk,  like the ID of the virtual machine (VM) that is associated with the Managed Disk.
- diskNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the Managed Disk.
- isExocomputeConfigured: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether exocompute is configured for the region in which the Managed Disk exists or not. When the value is true, exocompute can be used to perform tasks like file indexing.
- isFileIndexingEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether file indexing is enabled for this Managed Disk or not. When file indexing is enabled, Rubrik can scan through the file structure inside the managed disk in a protected environment where only the meta data like folder structure, file names, and file sizes will be readable by Rubrik.
