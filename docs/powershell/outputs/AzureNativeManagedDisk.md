### AzureNativeManagedDisk
An Azure Native Managed Disk that refers to the block storage designed to be used with Azure Virtual Machines. Some examples are: ultra disks, premium solid-state drives (SSD), standard SSDs, and standard hard disk drives (HDD). For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.

- region: AzureNativeRegion
  - Azure region where the Managed Disk is located.
- tags: list of AzureTags
  - List of tags associated with the Managed Disk.
- isRelic: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether the Managed Disk is a relic. When the value is true, the Managed Disk is a relic. A Managed Disk is a relic when it is unprotected or deleted, but the previously taken snapshots of the Managed Disk continue to exist within the Rubrik ecosystem.
- osType: AzureNativeVmOsType
  - Type of the Operating System (OS) installed on the Managed Disk.
- isAdeEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is enabled on the Managed Disk or not. When the value is true, ADE is enabled.
- diskSizeGib: System.Int32
  - Size of the Managed Disk in gigabytes (GiB).
- diskStorageTier: AzureNativeManagedDiskType
  - Storage tier of the Managed Disk.
- diskIopsReadWrite: System.Int64
  - Number of Input/Output operations Per Second (IOPS) allowed for the Managed Disk.
- diskMbpsReadWrite: System.Int64
  - Bandwidth allowed for the Managed Disk, in millions of bytes per second (MBps).
- availabilityZone: System.String
  - Availability Zone associated with the Managed Disk.
- attachmentSpecs: list of AttachmentSpecsForManagedDisks
  - Attachment Specifications are properties of the Managed Disk,  like the ID of the virtual machine (VM) that is associated with the Managed Disk.
- diskNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the Managed Disk.
- isExocomputeConfigured: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether exocompute is configured for the region in which the Managed Disk exists or not. When the value is true, exocompute can be used to perform tasks like file indexing.
- isFileIndexingEnabled: System.Boolean
  - Specifies whether file indexing is enabled for this managed disk or not. When enabled, Rubrik scans the file structure within the managed disk in a protected environment, where only the metadata such as folder structure, file names, and file sizes is accessible to Rubrik.
- cloudNativeId: System.String
  - Native ID of the Managed Disk.
- nativeName: System.String
  - Azure Native name of the object.
- fileIndexingStatus: FileIndexingStatus
  - Specifies the file indexing status for this managed disk. When enabled, Rubrik scans the file structure within the managed disk in a protected environment, where only the metadata such as folder structure, file names, and file sizes is accessible to Rubrik. If the status is not specified by the user, file indexing is automatically enabled when archival is configured.
- authorizedOperations: list of PolarisSnappableAuthorizedOperationsEnums
  - The authorized operations on the object.
- resourceGroup: AzureNativeResourceGroup
  - Resource Group of the Azure Native Managed Disk.
- allAttachedAzureNativeVirtualMachines: list of AzureNativeVirtualMachines
  - All Virtual Machines (VMs) attached to the Managed Disk.
- rscNativeObjectPendingSla: CompactSlaDomain
  - SLA Domain assignment which is pending on the Rubrik Security Cloud native objects.
- rscPendingObjectPauseAssignment: PendingObjectPauseAssignmentStatus
  - Object pause pending assignment details for RSC objects.
- id: System.String
  - FID of the hierarchy object.
- name: System.String
  - Name of the hierarchy object.
- objectType: HierarchyObjectTypeEnum
  - Type of this object.
- slaAssignment: SlaAssignmentTypeEnum
  - SLA Domain assignment type for this object.
- effectiveSlaDomain: SlaDomain
  - Effective SLA Domain of the hierarchy object.
- slaPauseStatus: System.Boolean
