- O365_SPECIFIC_TYPE - O365 specific type: O365_SHARED_USER, O365_SHARED_MAILBOX...This filter is
 introduced to support api-server since it is not convenient to add object-specific
 subtype knowledge there. To query for shared users, we can either:
 1. Specify O365_USER in object type AND this filter with value O365_SHARED_USER
 (api-server way)
 2. Specify O365_SHARED_USER in object type, ignore this filter
 (others should do this).
- NAME_EXACT_MATCH - There is already a filter called NAME which filters for all the rows
 where name is "LIKE" the provided string. We have a use-case in
 Azure where we would like to Filter by name but exact-match, not just
 similar match. The use case is that resource groups are identified by
 the tuple of subscription ID and resource group name, similarity
 measure will not distinguish between two similar names.
