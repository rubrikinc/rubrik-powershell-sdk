.SYNOPSIS
    ADMIN USE ONLY. Publish the current state of the main branch to the PowerShell Gallery.

.DESCRIPTION
    ADMIN USE ONLY.
    This script publishes the current state of the main branch to the PowerShell Gallery.
    Running it as a non-admin will not publish the module.
    A publishing key file is required to publish the module, and it must be
    set in the RSC_PSGalleryKeyFile environment variable.

    You can safely run: .\Utils\Publish-RscSdk.ps1
    to see what would have been done without actually doing it because
    it runs in Dry mode by default.
    Run with -NotDry to actually publish the module.

    This script will:
    1. Assemble the module for publishing in the Output.Publish directory;
    2. Publish the module to the PowerShell Gallery.
