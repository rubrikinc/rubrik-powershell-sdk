3. Note that we called the query without specifying any fields, and yet,
   the query returned a result. This is because when no fields are specified,
   the *exploratory* query is used.
   In production code, you want to specify the fields that
   need to be fetched in the reply.
   To do so, you first need to know the response type. You can get it from
   help with "Get-Help Query-RscAccount -Full" or by using the
   -ResponseType parameter:

4. The response type is RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.AccountSetting.

8. All schema types have an Fetch() method.
   It sets *some* fields in the object to non-null values.
   It is meant to be used when you don't know which fields you want to fetch,
   and you want to see what the query would look like.
   This is more of a development / debugging tool and is not 
   meant to be used in production code.
   In production code, you should always specify the fields you want to fetch.

9. All schema types also have an AsFieldSpec() method.
